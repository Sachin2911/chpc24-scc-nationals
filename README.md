CHPC 2023 Student Cluster Competition
========================================
Benchmarking and Competition instructions for the Center for High Performance Computing (CHPC) 2023 Student Cluster Compettion (SCC). Which is hosted by the National Integrated Cyber Infrastructure Systems (NICIS), a division of the South African Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR). For 2023 the competition will be held in person at the Kruger Gate Hotel in Mpumalanga, South Africa.

# Getting Started
------------------

The benchmarks were chosen to be compatible with the software environment that you previously setup in the first round of this competition. For this round, you are allowed to install any legally obtained software you wish to run the problems. However, using obscure, nonstandard software may limit the support you receive from the competition organizers. 

You are strongly encouraged to make use of any resource available to you. However, be advised that the competition organizers will provide limited technical support and assistance in building and running your applications. 

Team mentors are encouraged to support and motivate their teams. However, they may not do any of the work for the students. They are strictly there to provide guidance and suggestions, and are there to participate in the conference for their own benefit as well. 

Team captains will each be issued a competition USB flash drive. This is how the teams will be issued with their benchmarks and how teams will submit their results. Only the Team captain can approach the organizers’ booth, to submit and/or receive benchmarks. Only one Team captain is allowed at the organizer's booth at any time. 

To receive the next set of benchmarks, you will need to make a valid submission of the previous benchmark. Alternatively, you may forfeit penalty points should you be unable to submit a preceding result but want to attempt the next benchmark. The benchmarks will get progressively harder. 

The competition organizers will give teams a general indication of where they should be, in the morning at the beginning of the day, and again in the afternoon at the end of the day.

The competition will end on **Thursday, 7<sup>th</sup> of December at 10:00am**.

Rulings and decisions from the competition organizers are final. 

Good Luck!
